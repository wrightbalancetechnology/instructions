 #**Level 2 Certification:  Grip Size**   
------------------

**After almost 30 years of research into grip size we know the following:**
1.   Grip Size changes by Core Region Putter through Driver 
2. Grip size changes heel to toe Balance
3. The size of the grip allows you to test by 100 mil increments within your Student's Dominant Core Region & usually within industry standards.   
4. Five Simple measurements yield grip size when input on the Wright Balance site
5. When Lower & Upper Core players have exactly the same hand size, the Lower Core Player will play a larger Grip than the Upper Core Player 
7. When players test the range of 3 different sizes that fit their Dominant Core Region, they will experience changes in heel to toe balance.  Each of those sizes will square the hip line.  However, only one of those 3 sizes will test for maximum Power.   
 
**Why is Grip Size Important?**

Everything we do while holding or gripping something  to swinging a club, racquet or bat, walking with a cane or walker requires balance.  Our Wright Balance® research shows that grip and hand size can either support balance or create imbalance.

When you place something in your left and/or your right hand that does not fit your hand size, the improper size creates tension on one side of your core muscles, depending on Stance Width, and compromises balance.  This core tension causes your hips to rotate left or right to an “open” or “closed” position creating imbalance at ground level as shown in this illustration.

This includes anything from a golf club, putter, bat, tennis racquet, rake, broom, shovel or even a cane or crutches.   Grip Sizing has numerous applications, I am going to focus on Golf & Baseball in this overview.

When the grip size fits both the left and right hand, you will get a balance configuration similar to the one below.

**How do golfers play with the incorrect size?**  Players learn to place their hands on the club (stronger or weaker) in a way that compensates for an open or closed hip line.   The compensation still creates Core Tension, but a square hip line.  Core Tension is a predisposing condition for injury. 

#**Grip Size Measurements**

What is a “mil”?

Golf grips are measured in inches. One (1) mil is equal to 1/1000 inch.  The Golf industry has established the following Standards:
>1. The **Industry Standard** Grip Size is measured for the Left hand only, 2 inches down from the top ring of the Butt Cap of the Golf Grip for irons & **2 inches down** from the top for the Putter.
2.  An installed "Standard" Size grip measures 900 to 915 mils 
3. An installed "Undersized" Grip measures 850-70 mils
4. An installed Midsize Grip measures 960 mils
5. An installed "Jumbo" or "Oversized" Grip measures 1020 mils.
**NOTE**:  When considering these measurements, please know that the industry standard size is taken 2 inches down from the top ring of the Butt Cap of the Club  
 
Wright Balance® grip size standards are measured to the middle finger of the left hand on irons and woods and the middle finger of both hands on the putter.

Why is this important?  Some players grip down on the club.  The grip has a natural taper of about 50 to 70 mils from the left to right hand. Palm width, position of a player's hands on the club and the natural taper of the grip are reasons we measure to the middle finger of the left hand on irons and woods and the middle finger of both hands on the putter.  Please keep these factors in mind as you read this overview. 
  

**Grip Size vs Hand Size**

Bigger is not better.  Fitting your student's left hand for their irons and woods and their right and left hands for putter to the proper sizes is the goal.  A grip that fits your hand size sets your ideal ***heel to toe*** Balance, minimizes the stress in your core muscles, squares your hip line, facilitates maximum separation of the Upper & Lower Core in the swing and creates a balanced set up to the ball with greater Power recruitment from the ground (Ground Reaction Force).   

There is a belief among students & teachers that if you want to take your hands out of your swing, you should use bigger grips; if you want to use more hands in your game, get smaller grips.  If you are an Upper Core Player, you want to use your arms and hands.  If you are a Lower Core Player, you want to use your body.  An Upper Core Player's release is with the arms and hands.  The Lower Core Players release is with their body.  As might be expected, your Upper Core player will have smaller grips than the Lower Core, even in some cases when the Upper Core player has larger overall hands.  

Just because someone is tall and wide does not mean their hand size is large.  I have a senior tour player who is 6 feet 2 inches who uses an undersized grip.  Standard grips are too big for him.  Two time Masters winner Bubba Watson uses 12 extra wraps of tape under his right hand and 10 extra under his left (he is left-handed.)  US Open Winner Retief Goosen plays an oversize grip with 7 extra wraps.  

One of my students, PGA Tour Winner and former Long Drive Champion, Dennis Paulson uses a standard left hand grip size.  He put 6 extra wraps under his right hand (his hand size on our laser hand scanner measured   880 mils for his left hand and 876 mils for his right, precisely 6 extra wraps under his right hand).  Dennis intuitively found his correct size during his early years on tour.  He experimented with different grip sizes until he found the one that felt best to him.  

Another of my students, seven year PGA Tour veteran, Pat Burke measured 932 mils left hand and 873 right hand (also measured on our laser hand scanner.)  Pat had a career ending wrist injury in 1997 that he attributes to playing the incorrect grip sizes.  

If your student has have very large hands, there is a sizing adjustment to maintain Core Balance and move them to a size that will minimize swing weight changes and allow them to play a grip size closer to one of the industry standard grips.      

**How to Check the Current Grip Size**

Have your student assume one of their Dominant Core Region Stance Widths you determined in testing.

Place the Blue Bar and Bungee on your students hips.  Be certain to note that their hips are square to their stance line.  Have them add knee flex to be certain their hips are square **without** a club.  

From a "Standing Tall" position, ask your student to grip their 6 or 7 iron like a baseball bat.  (Note:  The orientation of your student's hands on the club will open or close their hip line when they assume a Golf Grip.  The majority of players grip a baseball bat without compensations in their grip.)  This will give you a true observation of the impact of grip size.  In the following illustration, LPGA Legends Tour Winner, Laurie Rinker demonstrates the impact of Grip Size using a baseball grip.

This video will provide you with the testing of grip size in a Middle Core Player.

Once the grip is assumed, ask your player to add a slight knee flex.  This knee flex will amplify  any Core Tension that will produce pelvic rotation if the grip does not fit.  Note that Laurie's hips remain square in the following illustration after adding knee flex.  This grip size fits her left hand.  Laurie's Grip Size is 915 mils.  I will return to that in a bit.

You test the Putter Grip Size the same way you do the full swing grip size, using the baseball grip with all fingers touching.   Notice how Colby's putter grip size does not fit.

When he sets up with a grip that fits his left hand, as in the photo illustration below, his hips are square.

First, let’s go through the hand measurement process and the entry of that information on the Wright Balance website. 

**Hand Measurements**

This illustration is a closeup of the Finger Measurement Form you were issued by the Wright Balance Team.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/aHWGvaX.jpg)

Note that the lines on this form are **Green** & **Blue**.  The **Green** lines have odd numbers and the **Blue** lines have even numbers.  There is a **Vertical** **BLUE** Line dividing the Finger measurement form.  That Vertical Blue Line is where your student will center the card between their fingers as they do their right & left middle finger measurements.

When your student uses this form, it is **important** that they place the measurement form **GENTLY** between their middle and ring fingers, ***hold the form at eye level*** and, using a magnifying glass, verbalize what color line and its corresponding number is at the tip of their middle finger.  Note: you are only measuring the Middle Finger of the left and right hands.  Again,  ***Do not apply downward pressure*** when the form is placed between the Ring and Middle Fingers.  Downward pressure will impact the measurement.
